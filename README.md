Jarvis is a command line tool (for current phase) which powers my daily work. Some works he can do include:

- ASR, voice command dedication, it can even add todo for automaticall;
- Scan the network, in every single PC he runs, he will sniffer the local network and gather as many useful information as possible for me;
- He can even call the camera, and detect useful information (activities) he sees;
- TTS, it can do tts inference on local in pure Rust;
- Control my IOT devices automatically in mqtt protocal.
